# Proxfy
This test plan lays out how we'll test the web platform to ensure it works smoothly, looks good, and is easy to use. We'll focus on functionality, user experience, responsiveness, and whether automation is possible.


# Test Execution and Automation Repository

## Introduction
This repository is designed to provide a structured approach to software testing, ensuring high-quality applications through a combination of manual and automated testing techniques. It includes essential testing artifacts such as test plans, execution reports, bug reports, and Selenium-based automation scripts to enhance efficiency and accuracy in the testing process.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- **Test Plan** - Comprehensive test plan outlining the testing approach, objectives, and scope.
- **Test Execution Report** - Detailed report of test execution results.
- **Bug Report** - List of identified defects with their descriptions, severity, and status.
- **Test Summary Report** - Summary of the overall testing process, including test coverage and key findings.
- **Automation Scripts** - Selenium-based automated test scripts for functional and regression testing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
3. Review the test documents in the `reports/` directory.
4. Run the automation scripts:
   ```sh
   mvn test
   ```
   *(Ensure Maven and Java are installed and configured correctly.)*

## 📝 Reports & Documentation

- **Test Plan** (`docs/Test_Plan.docx`)
- **Test Execution Report** (`reports/test_execution_report.xlsx`)
- **Bug Report** (`reports/bug_report.xlsx`)
- **Test Summary Report** (`reports/test_summary_report.pdf`)
- **Automation Scripts** (`automation/` directory, using Java and Selenium)

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Java (JDK 8 or later)
- Selenium WebDriver
- Maven
- TestNG/JUnit (as per project setup)

## 📋 Test Strategy

- **Manual Testing:** Exploratory testing, regression testing, and usability validation.
- **Automation Testing:** Selenium-based test scripts following the Page Object Model (POM).
- **Defect Tracking:** Bugs are logged and managed using GitHub Issues.
- **Entry & Exit Criteria:** Testing starts when the build is ready, and exits when all critical defects are resolved.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Selenium** - Automated functional testing.
- **Maven** - Dependency management and test execution
- **BrowserStack** - Cross-browser and device testing.
- **Google Sheets/Docs** - Test case and defect tracking.

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

- **Tight deadlines** may impact test coverage → Prioritize high-risk areas and automate repetitive tasks.
- **Changing requirements** may affect testing scope → Maintain flexibility in test planning.
