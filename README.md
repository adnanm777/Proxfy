## 📋 Test Strategy

- **Manual Testing:** Exploratory testing, regression testing, and usability validation.
- **Automation Testing:** Selenium-based test scripts
- **Defect Tracking:** Bugs are logged and managed using GitHub Issues.
- **Entry & Exit Criteria:** Testing starts when the build is ready, and exits when all critical defects are resolved.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Selenium** - Automated functional testing.
- **Maven** - Dependency management and test execution
- **BrowserStack** - Cross-browser and device testing.
- **Google Sheets/Docs** - Test case and defect tracking.

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

- **Tight deadlines** may impact test coverage → Prioritize high-risk areas and automate repetitive tasks.
- **Changing requirements** may affect testing scope → Maintain flexibility in test planning.
